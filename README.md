# React-tic-tac-
This was my first attempt at making a react app. This app is based on react documentation provided by facebook . They recommend it ,
so dont come after me please . I am a complete beginner. Here are some problems that I faced and I hope you may find the explanation 
useful
 
 #1 using ctrl+S in 'index.js' file would disturb the indentaion of the file <br>
    <b>Solution</b> : Disable beautify and reload Vs Code. Apparantely Beautify is not beautiful :P. The orignal problem is with Linters.

 #2 Error 4058 while running npm start<br>
    <b>Solution</b>: I had created a 'my app folder' inside another 'my app folder', and my working directory was the first folder 
    which didn't have a package.json file. I changed the  terminal directory to my  inner 'my app'folder. Complete Brainfreeze :D<br>
 <br>#3 Git push won't work<br>
    <b>Solution</b>: I had added the readme file directly from github hence it was absent from the local repository 
    so before pushing the made changes i need to get the file locally so i used <i>git pull</i> first got my 'readme.md' file and then again 
    pushed into repo using <i>'git push origin master'</i>    

    stack overflow is the best
