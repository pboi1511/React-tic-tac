# React-tic-tac-
This was my first attempt at making a react app. This app is based on react documentation provided by facebook . They recommend it ,
so dont come after me please . I am a complete beginner. Here are some problems that I faced and I hope you may find the explanation 
useful
 
 #1 using ctrl+S in 'index.js' file would disturb the indentaion of the file <br>
    Solution : Disable beautify and reload Vs Code. Apparantely Beautify is not beautiful :P
 
 #2 Error 4058 while running npm start<br>
    Solution : I had created a 'my app folder' inside another 'my app folder', and my working directory was the first folder 
    which didn't have a package.json file. I changed the  terminal directory to my  inner 'my app'folder. Complete Brainfreeze :D
